# memory-allocation-simulator
This project is a memory allocation simulator developed for an Operating Systems (OS) class, using the First Fit algorithm.

## Project requirements:

Memory capacity: 1000 bytes  
Number of cycles to run: 1000 cycles  
Process sizes: varies from 10 bytes to 50 bytes (randomly generated)  
Process lifecycles: varies from 5 up to 10 cycles (randomly generated)  
-Every process should be allocated in a contigous area in memory, otherwise it should be discarded  
-Print the memory allocation after each process created  
-Show number of process that could not be fit
